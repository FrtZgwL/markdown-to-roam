# In what ways is roams import lacking? #

An import of `examples/test_6` shows some flaws of Roams Markdown import:

1. Headings keep the hashtags on the end of the line.
2. The text under a heading can't be folded under that heading.
3. The first level 1 heading should be suggested as a title for the Roam page
4. Lists with `+` keep the `+`.




process line:
If we get some heading
    remember heading level
    remember heading
    for every subsequent line:
        if text:
            nest text under heading
        if heading:
            go back depending on level
            repeat
